subtitle: ""
summary: "The 17th Lok Sabha is being termed as a historic session in the country's legislative history. However, despite the immediate signs of success, being elected as an MP and participation in legislative and consultative business are different concepts. They need to be observed categorically to understand how the recently concluded session fared in terms of participation. With available data uploaded by the Lok Sabha secretariat, we present interactive and dynamic data visualizations to aid the reader in unpacking the recently concluded 17th Lok Sabha’s inaugural cum Budget session‘s ‘Story of Participation’."

The 17th Lok Sabha is being termed as a historic session in the country's legislative history. However, despite the immediate signs of success, being elected as an MP and participation in legislative and consultative business are different concepts.
